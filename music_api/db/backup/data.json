All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nSo, I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo, close your eyes\nEscape this town for a little while\nOh, oh\n\n'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",
